Optimizing E-Commerce Store Profits

This project aimed to enhance the profitability of an e-commerce jewelry store, “630 Jewelers,” by developing a product recommender system and an inventory management model. Using data from customer purchase history, the recommender was built using content-based filtering and cosine similarity to suggest products based on item features. For inventory management, an Exponential Smoothing model, specifically the Holt-Winters method, was applied to forecast demand for a high-frequency product, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.85, indicating satisfactory forecasting accuracy. The project’s recommendations include integrating the recommender at checkout and in email marketing, prioritizing slow-selling inventory, and using the inventory model to adjust stock orders. These improvements aim to increase sales and optimize inventory management for the business.

This project was completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. A paper and a slideshow are also available for viewing.
