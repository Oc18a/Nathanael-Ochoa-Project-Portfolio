Analyzing Previous Olympic Games Data

This project analyzed past Summer Olympic Games data to predict the outcomes of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Using datasets on Olympic sports, athlete events, and medals from 1896-2020, I focused on the top countries with the most medals—USA, Australia, and China—due to Russia’s absence in recent Games. By comparing medal trends and performance, I estimated which country might outperform the others in 2024. The data counted medals awarded to athletes or teams, which may have caused slight discrepancies compared to typical medal counts.

This project was completed using the R programming language, and both an Rmd file and a PDF version are available for viewing.
