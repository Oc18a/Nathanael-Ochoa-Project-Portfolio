## Projects

### [Analyzing Previous Olympic Games Data](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Portfolio.github.io/tree/main/Analyzing%20Previous%20Olympic%20Games%20Data)
- This project analyzed past Summer Olympic Games data to predict the outcomes of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Using datasets on Olympic sports, athlete events, and medals from 1896-2020, I focused on the top countries with the most medals—USA, Australia, and China—due to Russia's absence in recent Games. By comparing medal trends and performance, I estimated which country might outperform the others in 2024. The data counted medals awarded to athletes or teams, which may have caused slight discrepancies compared to typical medal counts.

### [Childcare Company Market Expansion Analysis](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Childcare%20Company%20Market%20Expansion%20Analysis)
- This project aimed to provide actionable insights into weekly median child care prices across U.S. counties and cities to support DV Child Care's potential market expansion. The analysis, based on a decade of data (2008-2018), identified a clear trend of rising prices over time, reflecting broader economic shifts. I focused on presenting findings through an interactive dashboard, a summary brief, and a slideshow tailored for stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making. Assumptions about data accuracy were made for simplicity, with some variables excluded for clarity. Although demographic correlations with pricing weren't fully explored, the analysis provides a strong foundation for understanding market trends and informing expansion strategies.

### [City Weather with API](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/City%20Weather%20with%20API)
- This program interacts with a web service to retrieve weather data for a user-specified location within the U.S. Users can search by city name and state code or ZIP/postal code and specify their preferred units of measurement (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit). The program allows for multiple consecutive searches, with input validation checks in place to ensure only valid data is entered. It is designed to provide accurate and accessible weather information with a simple and user-friendly interface.

### [Data Analysis with SQL](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20SQL)
- In OpenClassrooms' mock project, I was hired as a freelance Data Analyst by Datazine, a French online magazine. Over a 3-month contract, my tasks included identifying key user indicators, determining the optimal times for content posting, and assessing the potential profit of launching an English version of the magazine in the U.S. I created a database in MySQL Workbench, using SQL create statements to establish six tables and then uploaded six provided CSV files. I followed a PowerPoint guide that included prompts with questions, SQL query spaces, and answer sections to complete the project.

### [Data Preparation Course Project (TBA)](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Preparation%20(need%20to%20update))
- This term project didn't turn out as expected so may be replaced with a different project.

### [Manga to Anime - Predicting Adaptation Potential](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Manga%20to%20Anime%20-%20Predicting%20Adaptation%20Potential)
- This project aimed to develop a predictive model for determining which manga series are worth adapting into anime, using data from MyAnimeList. By analyzing manga ratings and comparing them to anime adaptation ratings, the goal was to create a model that could assist executives in making informed decisions about resource allocation for new anime projects. After cleaning and preparing the data, the analysis compared several machine learning models, ultimately selecting the Random Forest Classifier for its highest accuracy of 93.5%. Despite challenges such as missing data and the need to average anime scores, the model showed promise, and further refinements could enhance its predictive power. The project highlighted the potential for data analytics in the anime industry to minimize financial risks and maximize opportunities.

### [Optimizing E-Commerce Store Profits](https://github.com/Oc18a/Nathanael-Ochoa-Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Optimizing%20E-Commerce%20Store%20Profits)
- This project aimed to enhance the profitability of an e-commerce jewelry store, "630 Jewelers," by developing a product recommender system and an inventory management model. Using data from customer purchase history, the recommender was built using content-based filtering and cosine similarity to suggest products based on item features. For inventory management, an Exponential Smoothing model, specifically the Holt-Winters method, was applied to forecast demand for a high-frequency product, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.85, indicating satisfactory forecasting accuracy. The project’s recommendations include integrating the recommender at checkout and in email marketing, prioritizing slow-selling inventory, and using the inventory model to adjust stock orders. These improvements aim to increase sales and optimize inventory management for the business.

### [DSC 670 Term Project (wip)]()
- The goal is to help managers easily create break and lunch schedules based on their team's daily work schedule. Previous schedule data is being collected and will be used to fine-tune a generative AI model. No personal information is being used in the data collection process.

### [DSC 680 Project 2 (wip)]()
- A 70,000-patient study is being used to determine if there is a correlation between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.

### [DSC 680 Project 3 (TBA)]()
- Will be added once complete.
