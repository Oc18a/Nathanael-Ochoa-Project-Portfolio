City Weather with API

This program interacts with a web service to retrieve weather data for a user-specified location within the U.S. Users can search by city name and state code or ZIP/postal code and specify their preferred units of measurement (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit). The program allows for multiple consecutive searches, with input validation checks in place to ensure only valid data is entered. It is designed to provide accurate and accessible weather information with a simple and user-friendly interface.
