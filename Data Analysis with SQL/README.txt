Data Analysis with SQL

In OpenClassrooms' mock project, I was hired as a freelance Data Analyst by Datazine, a French online magazine. Over a 3-month contract, my tasks included identifying key user indicators, determining the optimal times for content posting, and assessing the potential profit of launching an English version of the magazine in the U.S. I created a database in MySQL Workbench, using SQL create statements to establish six tables and then uploaded six provided CSV files. I followed a PowerPoint guide that included prompts with questions, SQL query spaces, and answer sections to complete the project.
