Childcare Company Market Expansion Analysis

This project aimed to provide actionable insights into weekly median child care prices across U.S. counties and cities to support DV Child Care’s potential market expansion. The analysis, based on a decade of data (2008-2018), identified a clear trend of rising prices over time, reflecting broader economic shifts. I focused on presenting findings through an interactive dashboard, a summary brief, and a slideshow tailored for stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making. Assumptions about data accuracy were made for simplicity, with some variables excluded for clarity. Although demographic correlations with pricing weren’t fully explored, the analysis provides a strong foundation for understanding market trends and informing expansion strategies.

This project was completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Three different visualizations/mediums were required, and I chose an interactive dashboard, a summary brief, and a slideshow. The dashboard link is provided in the slideshow.
